          <div class="p__summary">This project aims to combat polarization in media by creating a news aggregator that identifies media bias &amp; fake news. My teammates <span>Janice Liu</span>, <span>Julia Hawley</span> and Soundarya Senthilnathan went through the product development lifecycle to develop a potential solution with the help of our mentor Nikhil Bose.</div>
          <div class="p__summary">This project was presented at Project Jam by Product Buds, an online community of budding Product Managers. Our team was nominated for the final round of presentations out of 40 total teams. We were given an opportunity to pitch our product to over 120 attendees and a panel of 6 Product Managers from Google, Playstation, Workday, RocketBlocks, LinkedIn, and Salesforce.</div>

      <p class="p__text">To translate our goal of better informing people to a product, we needed to determine exactly who the audience is and what they need.</p>

      <h4 class="h__overline">For what?</h4>
      <h6 class="h__subject">Survey</h6>
      <p class="p__text">We conducted 2 user surveys and collected 200+ responses. We grouped responses together to find common underlying themes</p>
      <div class="w-layout-grid grid-9">
        <p>&quot;Transparency in the <strong>source</strong>&quot;<br></p>
        <p>&quot;I wish there was also a way to see WHAT exactly each news <strong>source is biased</strong> towards&quot;<br></p>
        <p>&quot;I consume a lot of news that&#x27;s linked from twitter/reddit so finding new sources that <strong>bring me out of my bubble </strong>that are accessible&quot;<br></p>
        <p>&quot;Less <strong>biased </strong>news, especially in terms of reporting accurately of what HAPPENS rather than what is desired to happen&quot;<br><br></p>
        <p>&quot;<strong>Sources</strong>! So often statistics are cited with nothing to back them up -- I notice this more on social media posts or videos, less so on written news apps&quot;<br></p>
        <p>&quot;Inclusion of <strong>multiple perspectives</strong> and more diverse information that actually tells us what&#x27;s going on in the world instead of the tidbits the media chooses to share with us&quot;<br></p>
        <p>&quot;I want to <strong>know about the biases</strong> and/or corporate sponsorships of the news sources &amp; authors I consume news from.&quot;<br></p>
        <p>&quot;Paywall removal - it gatekeeps valuable knowledge on the basis of wealth&quot;<br><br></p>
        <p>&quot;Feeling limited to bias and certain thoughts. I want to hear <strong>all perspectives</strong> rather than just one side.&quot;<br></p>
